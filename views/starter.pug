            p Are you an event organizer, venue, artist, DJ or just a social butterfly that loves getting people together for a good party!?
            p Looking for different and affordable ways of attracting more party-loving people to your events? (Facebook Ads are great for â€˜reachâ€™, but how about driving real motivated party people to your event? - see who & how many party people you can reach & how the ROI stacks up against FB ads)
            p By becoming a â€˜Party Starterâ€™ your events will be promoted in the app to our very targeted audience of people who love to party. Regular events are free to add, but featured events appear on the 'Explore' screen of the app & generally get 3x more attendees than regular events.
