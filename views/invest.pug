          h2 ðŸ’¸ What if I want to invest in the company & share in the success?
          
          p Youâ€™re in luck! For a limited time, weâ€™re opening up our investment round to non-institutional investors: users of the app, and regular people with some spare savings, who believe in our mission - of connecting people in an authentic wayâ€¦ to party (& more beyond that - ask to see our pitch deck, for the bigger vision we are working towards & <a href="https://medium.com/@Dan_Fennessy/my-why-394400148156" target="_blank">read Why</a>).
          
          p Great investment terms for getting on board as an early investor (same as offered to other friends & family recently invested), simple & the possibility to invest from anywhere in the world, plus a low minimum investment amount to be involved.

          p Opportunity become a real part of our company & share in the upside when we make it big!
          
          p Investors donâ€™t get a badge on their profilesâ€¦ but hopefully weâ€™ll make that up to you - with a bucketload of cash in the not too distant future! ðŸ’¸

          p Get in touch to see our pitch deck, investment terms, minimum investment amount & to set up a meeting or call with PartyWith Founder & CEO Dan: <a href="mailto:dan@partywith.co">dan@partywith.co</a>
